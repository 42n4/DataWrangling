# DataWrangling

> Data science is 90% cleaning the data and 10% complaining about cleaning the data. 

## About
In the realm of data wrangling, [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) from R and [pandas](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) from Python dominate. This repo is meant to be a comprehensive, easy to use reference guide on how to do common operations with data.table *and* pandas, including a cross-reference between them as well as speed comparisons.

## Call for contribution
I'd like to encourage contribution for this project - it's well suited for it. Also note that I'm much more comfortable using data.table than pandas, so it's likely I've done some suboptimal wrangling in pandas.
